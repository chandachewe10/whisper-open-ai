00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400
Good morning everyone, it's Nuno here and welcome to the third episode of the morning

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.840
podcast.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.800
Today I would like to talk about the tools I use for my daily job.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:29.320
And I actually received this question a lot, so I hope this podcast helps to clarify some

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.400
of those questions.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.480
Now as a laptop I use a MacBook Pro 14 inch 2021.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.540
It's an M1 and I'm very happy with it.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:53.160
It's fast and I've been using Able for the last 10 years I think.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.720
And it always surprised me how stable, fast it can be and just is such a high quality

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.120
product that I have no intentions of changing.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.840
As a local server I use a lot of LVL.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.240
Now I receive hundreds of messages, people trying to convince me how Docker is convenient

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:27.080
and how just easy it is, but honestly nothing sounds or looks more convenient than Valet

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.360
itself.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:41.000
It just works, takes none time at all to just start with it and just feels better for me.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.480
As an IDE or an editor for development, I mainly use Sublime Text.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.440
And this is one of those pieces of software that I've been using for years and also works

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440
for me.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.360
And I feel really fast with it.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:14.440
Kind of difficult to explain when there is so many popular editor IDE tools out there,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.320
but in terms of speed of navigating on a code and then jumping between files, nothing for

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.200
me is as fast as Sublime Text.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.760
Even for simple tasks as reviewing some code or trying to just brainstorm how I will develop

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:44.400
a certain feature, Sublime Text is for me still the best tool for that out there.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.420
Now I must admit that occasionally I may use PhpStorm for refactoring.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:01.920
Now PhpStorm is very popular between PHP developers and I must admit that the refactoring capacities

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.120
of this tool are quite impressive.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200
So I may switch to PhpStorm when it comes to that.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:18.060
Within PhpStorm, I usually mainly two plugins, the Laravel IDE one, which you may know already,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.400
and obviously the PASS plugin, which gives me a great experience when using PASS and

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.920
Laravel all together.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.920
Now switching for the terminal, I use a tool called IPER.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.440
It's not as popular as iTerm2, I feel like, but it's definitely more pretty.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.180
And that's the main reason I use IPER.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.160
As a database management tool, I use SQLase.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.300
And again, SQLase is this kind of old school tool, but it still works for me.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.180
I know that some people use TablePlus, but I like SQLase a lot.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.060
As a tool to serve those databases, because Laravel Valet can serve like the HTTP part

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.740
of your application, but it still needs something to actually serve those databases.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:30.100
And I use a very simple tool, call it dbging, which allows me to have a simple MySQL 8 instance

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.540
running locally.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:41.140
And I just start this instance, if I want to, on the dbing UI.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.620
Now some last tools I use as well as a password manager.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.460
I like a lot the LastPass application.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.300
I've been using this for a while now, even though I've seen some recent tweets about

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.740
how insecure this service might be.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.260
So I may consider in the future to change.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.540
As a tool to talk with my friends, obviously at work, I use Slack to communicate within

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.100
the Laravel team.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.020
But to talk with my personal buddies, I usually use Telegram.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.620
For music, I use Spotify.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.680
For emailing, I use Gmail.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.000
For all my side project servers, I tend to default to Forge.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.940
And if it's a big project, I may use Vapor to begin with.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.380
Finally, for my own blog, which is OthellonForge, I have a newsletter service and I've been

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.780
using MailCoach since the beta stage and it's working great for me.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.780
And that's it.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:06.340
I hope you enjoyed this morning episode and see you next time.
