00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to FinTech Plus Sync's 2nd quarter 2023 earnings call.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We've had a stellar Q2 with a revenue of $125 million, a 25% increase year over year.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Our gross profit margin stands at a solid 58%, due in part to cost efficiencies gained from our scalable business model.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Our EBITDA has surged to $37.5 million, translating to a remarkable 30% EBITDA margin.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Our net income for the quarter rose to $16 million, which is a noteworthy increase from $10 million in Q2 2022.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Our total addressable market has grown substantially, thanks to the expansion of our high-yield savings product line and the new RoboAdvisor platform.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We've been diversifying our asset-backed securities portfolio, investing heavily in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We've also invested $25 million in AAA-rated corporate bonds, enhancing our risk-adjusted returns.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000
As for our balance sheet, total assets reached $1.5 billion, with total liabilities at $900 million, leaving us with a solid equity base of $600 million.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Our debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our expansionary phase.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We continue to see substantial organic user growth, with customer acquisition cost dropping by 15% and lifetime value growing by 25%.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Our LTVCAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5X.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In terms of risk management, we have a value-at-risk model in place, with a 99% confidence level indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed $5 million in the next trading day.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage, and have a healthy tier-one capital ratio of 12.5%.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Our forecast for the coming quarter is positive. We expect revenue to be around $135 million, an 8% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven primarily by our cutting-edge blockchain solutions and AI-driven predictive analytics.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our fintech subsidiary, Pay Plus, which we expect to raise $200 million, significantly bolstering our liquidity and paving the way for aggressive growth strategies.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We thank our shareholders for their continued faith in us, and we look forward to an even more successful Q3. Thank you so much.
