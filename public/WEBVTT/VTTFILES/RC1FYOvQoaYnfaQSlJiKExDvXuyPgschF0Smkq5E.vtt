I think the side projects that are always the most successful are the projects that are solving your own problems.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And then you can't lose if you do that, because when you build something like Vue or Laravel or Laravel Forge and you're solving your own problem,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
even if no one uses it, you made your own life better.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But the chances are, actually, that if you have the problem, I feel like probably thousands of other developers also have the problem,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
especially if it's like a daily frustration that you're encountering.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So if you build your side project around that kind of thing, and you're not trying to sort of solve this problem out of a vacuum,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that you're trying to guess at a problem, you don't really want to do that when you're doing a side project.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I think you want it to be something that you're encountering every day that's just wearing you down, it's annoying,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and if you can crack that problem and really make it easier for yourself, chances are thousands of other developers' lives are going to be improved as well,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and it's going to be really successful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Every product I've ever launched, people have critiqued it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If you go on a site like reddit.com, like a PHP subreddit, a JavaScript reddit, every product I've ever launched,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
actually I would say most of the responses, or even half the responses have been,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I don't see a market for this, I don't know who's going to use this,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you could do this another way that would be better.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But every time, the product has been more successful than I expected, and none of that even mattered.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Sure, there's a lot of people that it's not good for, but there's many more people that are just sort of the silent majority

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that they just want a great tool that makes their life easier, and they're happy.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Even the thing I launched yesterday, the first comment was, there's no market for this.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But I mean, I know they're going to be wrong, because there's already like 4,000 people on the waiting list,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so there's obviously a market, but I don't know man, it's crazy, you just can't trust that.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
You can't go off internet comments, or random GitHub comments, but I know how troubling it can be,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
like I've sat at dinner and been enraged the whole time I was eating at some random comment,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but you just can't let it bother you too much, as hard as it is, and just got to keep pressing forward really.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think you should follow your own instinct for the most part,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and you should always be mindful of who the advice is coming from.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
They're not really invested in the situation, they're just sort of throwing their two cents in,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and just another voice in the crowd.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And you have to trust your gut a lot, because you're the one, you're solving the problem,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you've interacted with it every day, and if people are just sort of, you know,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
it's really easy to give an opinion, so if they're not invested, I wouldn't put too much weight in it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you really feel strongly about it, I would say just push forward,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and I think you'll get further than you might expect, if you just trust your own instinct.
