00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.520
What would I do without your smart mouth?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.760
Drawing me in and you kicking me out.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.840
You got my head spinning, no kidding.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.880
I can't pin you down.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.680
What's going on in that beautiful mind?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.520
I'm on your magical mystery ride.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.000
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.800
but I'll be all right.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.440
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fire.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.120
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.960
Because all of me loves all of you.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.880
Love your curves and all your edges.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.680
All your perfect imperfections.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.360
Give your all to me.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.200
I'll give my all to you.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.160
You're my end and my beginning.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.680
Even when I lose, I'm winning.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.280
Because I give you all of me.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.480
And you give me all of you.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.920
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.400
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.320
The world is beating you down.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.160
I'm around through every mood.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.120
You're my downfall.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.840
You're my muse.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.760
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.160
I can't stop singing.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.280
It's ringing in my head for you.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.920
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fire.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.600
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.440
Because all of me loves all of you.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.360
Love your curves and all your edges.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.160
All your perfect imperfections.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.640
Give your all to me.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.640
I'll give my all to you.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.600
You're my end and my beginning.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.080
Even when I lose, I'm winning.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.680
Because I give you all of me.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.680
And you give me all of you.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.160
Give me all of you.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:29.080
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.560
Risking it all though it's hard.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.280
Because all of me loves all of you.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.280
Love your curves and all your edges.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.080
All your perfect imperfections.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.560
Give your all to me.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.640
I'll give my all to you.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.520
You're my end and my beginning.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.000
Even when I lose, I'm winning.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.680
Because I give you all of me.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.160
And you give me all of you.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.640
I give you all of me.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.360
And you give me all of you.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.920
Oh.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.240
Oh.
