00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What would I do without your smart mouth, drawin' me in and you kickin' me out?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You got my head spinnin', no kiddin', I can't pin you down.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind? I'm on your magical mystery ride.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000
My head's underwater, but I'm breathin' fire. You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Cause all of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you. You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Cause I give you all of me, and you give me all of you.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
How many times do I have to tell you? Even when you're cryin' you're beautiful too.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The world is beatin' you down, I'm around through every mood.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're my downfall, you're my muse. My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I can't stop singin', it's ringin' in my head for you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:33.000
My head's underwater, but I'm breathin' fire. You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Cause all of me loves all of you. Love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you. You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Cause I give you all of me, and you give me all of you.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:41.000

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I give you all of me, and you give me all of you.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I give you all of me, and you give me all of you.
