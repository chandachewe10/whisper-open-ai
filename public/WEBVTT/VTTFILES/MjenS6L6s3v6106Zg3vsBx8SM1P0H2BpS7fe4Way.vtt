00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to FinTech Plus Sync's 2nd quarter 2023 earnings call.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.080
I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.940
We've had a stellar Q2 with a revenue of $125 million, a 25% increase year over year.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.840
Our gross profit margin stands at a solid 58%, due in part to cost efficiencies gained

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.860
from our scalable business model.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:36.720
Our EBITDA has surged to $37.5 million, translating to a remarkable 30% EBITDA margin.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.779
Our net income for the quarter rose to $16 million, which is a noteworthy increase from

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:45.139
$10 million in Q2 2022.

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:49.639
Our total addressable market has grown substantially, thanks to the expansion of our high-yield

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:55.299
savings product line and the new RoboAdvisor platform.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.220
We've been diversifying our asset-backed securities portfolio, investing heavily in

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.540
collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.540
We've also invested $25 million in AAA-rated corporate bonds, enhancing our risk-adjusted

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.900
returns.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.260
As for our balance sheet, total assets reached $1.5 billion, with total liabilities at $900

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.940
million, leaving us with a solid equity base of $600 million.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.059
Our debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our expansionary

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:33.220
phase.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.800
We continue to see substantial organic user growth, with customer acquisition cost dropping

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.059
by 15% and lifetime value growing by 25%.

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:54.459
Our LTVCAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5X.

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.779
In terms of risk management, we have a value-at-risk model in place, with a 99% confidence level

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:07.580
indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed $5 million in the next trading day.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.300
We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage, and have a healthy Tier 1 capital

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.919
ratio of 12.5%.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.580
Our forecast for the coming quarter is positive.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.139
We expect revenue to be around $135 million, and 8% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:33.300
primarily by our cutting-edge blockchain solutions and AI-driven predictive analytics.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.419
We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our fintech subsidiary, Pay Plus, which

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:44.160
we expect to raise $200 million, significantly bolstering our liquidity and paving the way

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.580
for aggressive growth strategies.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.820
We thank our shareholders for their continued faith in us, and we look forward to an even

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.899
more successful Q3.

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:54.820
Thank you so much.
