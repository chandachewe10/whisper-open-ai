00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to FinTech Plus Inc. second quarter 2023 earnings call.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.080
I'm John Doe, CEO of FinTech Plus.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.940
We've had a stellar Q2 with a revenue of 125 million, a 25 percent increase year over year.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.480
Our gross profit margin stands at a solid 58 percent due in part to cost efficiencies

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
gained from our scalable business model.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.720
Our EBITDA has surged to 37.5 million, translating to a remarkable 30 percent EBITDA margin.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.760
Our net income for the quarter rose to 16 million, which is a noteworthy increase from

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.140
10 million in Q2 2022.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.640
Our total addressable market has grown substantially thanks to the expansion of our high yield

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.320
savings product line and the new RoboAdvisor platform.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.220
We've been diversifying our asset-backed securities portfolio, investing heavily in

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.560
collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.560
We've also invested 25 million in AAA-rated corporate bonds, enhancing our risk-adjusted

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
returns.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.080
As for our balance sheet, total assets reached 1.5 billion, with total liabilities at 900

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.960
million, leaving us with a solid equity base of 600 million.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.080
Our debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.5, a healthy figure considering our expansionary

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.200
phase.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.800
We continue to see substantial organic user growth, with customer acquisition cost dropping

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.080
by 15 percent and lifetime value growing by 25 percent.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:54.460
Our LTVCAC ratio is at an impressive 3.5 X.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.420
In terms of risk management, we have a value-at-risk model in place, with a 99 percent confidence

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.620
level indicating that our maximum loss will not exceed 5 million in the next trading day.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.300
We've adopted a conservative approach to managing our leverage and have a healthy tier-one capital

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.940
ratio of 12.5 percent.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.600
Our forecast for the coming quarter is positive.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.040
We expect revenue to be around 135 million and 8 percent quarter-over-quarter growth,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.360
driven primarily by our cutting-edge blockchain solutions and AI-driven predictive analytics.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.440
We're also excited about the upcoming IPO of our fintech subsidiary, Pay Plus, which

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.200
we expect to raise 200 million, significantly bolstering our liquidity and paving the way

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.640
for aggressive growth strategies.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.880
We thank our shareholders for their continued faith in us, and we look forward to an even

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.920
more successful Q3.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.840
Thank you so much.
