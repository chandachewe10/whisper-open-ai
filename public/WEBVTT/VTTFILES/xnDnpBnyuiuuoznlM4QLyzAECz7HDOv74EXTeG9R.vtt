I think that the side projects that are always the most successful are the projects that are solving your own problems.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And then you can't lose if you do that, because when you build something like Vue or Laravel or Laravel Forge and you're solving your own problem,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
even if no one uses it, you made your own life better.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But the chances are actually that if you have the problem, I feel like probably thousands of other developers also have the problem,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
especially if it's like a daily frustration that you're encountering.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So if you build your side project around that kind of thing and you're not trying to sort of solve this problem out of a vacuum,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that you're trying to guess at a problem, you don't really want to do that when you're doing a side project.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I think you want it to be something that you're encountering every day that's just wearing you down, it's annoying.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And if you can crack that problem and really make it easier for yourself, chances are thousands of other developers' lives are going to be improved as well.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And it's going to be really successful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Every product I've ever launched, people have critiqued it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Almost, like if you go on a site like reddit.com, like a PHP subreddit, a JavaScript reddit,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
every product I've ever launched, actually I would say most of the responses or even half the responses have been,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I don't see a market for this. I don't know who's going to use this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You could do this another way that would be better.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But every time the product has been more successful than I expected and none of that even mattered.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Sure, there's a lot of people that it's not good for, but there's many more people that are just sort of the silent majority

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that they just want a great tool that makes their life easier and they're happy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Even the thing I launched yesterday, the first comment was, there's no market for this.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But I mean, I know they're going to be wrong.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There's already like 4,000 people on the waiting list, so there's obviously a market.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But I don't know, man, it's crazy.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You just can't trust that. You can't go off internet comments or random GitHub comments.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But I know how troubling it can be.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Like I've sat at dinner and been enraged the whole time I was eating at some random comment.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But you just can't let it bother you too much, as hard as it is, and just got to keep pressing forward, really.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think you should follow your own instinct for the most part.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And you should always be mindful of who the advice is coming from.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They're not really invested in the situation.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They're just sort of throwing their two cents in and sort of just another voice in the crowd.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And you have to trust your gut a lot because you're solving the problem you've interacted with every day.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And if people are just sort of, you know, it's really easy to give like an opinion.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So if they're not invested, I wouldn't put too much weight in it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
If you really feel strongly about it, I would say just push forward.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And I think you'll get further than you might expect if you just trust your own instinct.
