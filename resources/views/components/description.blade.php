            Only files that are less than 25 MB are supported. If you have an audio file that is longer than that, you will need to break it up into chunks of 25 MB's or less or use a compressed audio format. To get the best performance, it is good that you avoid breaking the audio up mid-sentence as this may cause some context to be lost.
